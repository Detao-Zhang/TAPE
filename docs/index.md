## Tissue-AdaPtive autoEncoder (TAPE)
TAPE is a deep-learning tool for reserchers to deconvolve bulk RNA-seq data to estimate the cell-type fractions and the cell-type-specific gene expression. This model is developed by [computational biology group](https://liyu95.com) at [CUHK](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk) with help from other institutions and groups.

For more information about TAPE, the related article ***Deep autoencoder for interpretable tissue-adaptive deconvolution and cell-type-specific gene analysis*** is accepted by *Nature Communications*. The concrete usage about TAPE will be introduced in the [Installation](installation.md) and [Usage](usage.md) part. Other supplementary information about [Datasets](datasets.md) and [Experiments](experiments.md) may also be helpful to you.
